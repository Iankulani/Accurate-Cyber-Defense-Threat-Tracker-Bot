# Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Threat-Tracker-Bot
Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Threat-Tracker-Bot is a high-performance cybersecurity tool engineered to detect, track, and report various forms of digital threats across a network environment in real time.



Designed for both individual professionals and enterprise-level security operations centers (SOCs), this bot actively scans network traffic, monitors suspicious activities, and identifies malicious patterns using intelligent threat-detection algorithms. It efficiently tracks potential intrusions, malware behavior, unauthorized access attempts, and anomalies that may indicate zero-day exploits or coordinated attacks.

One of the core features of this tool is its seamless integration with the Telegram app. 
The bot is configured with a secure Telegram Bot Token and a custom Chat ID, allowing it to send real-time notifications and threat alerts directly to the user’s Telegram account or group. 
This ensures that system administrators and security teams receive instant updates, even when they are away from their monitoring stations. 
Telegram messages can include details like source IPs, timestamps, severity levels, and recommended actions, enabling faster incident response and better situational awareness.

In addition to threat tracking, the bot maintains detailed logs and generates forensic-ready data archives for future analysis and legal compliance. 
It supports modular plugins for DNS monitoring, port scanning detection, brute-force prevention, and anomaly detection, making it adaptable to a wide range of environments.

The Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Threat-Tracker-Bot is lightweight, easy to deploy on Windows or Linux, and comes with a customizable configuration file for adapting to different threat landscapes. 
Its Telegram integration reduces alert fatigue and empowers users to act promptly on verified threats.

Whether deployed in corporate networks, educational institutions, or small business environments, this tool offers a reliable, always-on line of defense. 
It’s not just a bot—it’s your real-time cyber guardian, ensuring constant visibility and protection against the ever-evolving digital threat landscape.
